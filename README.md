# Lifehack 2022: Values in Students

Lifehack 2022 by NUS Computing. This is the project done by Team SPECIAL FORCES. 

## What it does
Our hack is a web application targeted at creating a platform that is aimed towards encouraging schools to involve their students to partake in volunteering works. While the overall concept of the web application is similar volunteers.sg, which serves as a volunteering web application for the general public, our application is focused towards schools' students.

With system like LEAPS 2.0 in placed for school students to encourage participation for Value in Action activities, the platform is built specifically to cater for students to find such activities to participate.

We wish to approach Non-Profit Organization to collaborate and utilize the platform to open volunteering works for students specifically. Students can also personally contact these NPO and self-organize such events, which is also encouraged by the LEAPS 2.0 system, which then allow others students on the platform to join.

With additional information that we stored in the system such as hours participated, it can be used to show teachers the total hours participated.
